    "### Data set selection rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "> Why did you select this data set?\n",
    "> - > I chose this data set because it shows the patterns and trend about climate changes that can helps us identify the realtionship of the cause adn aftermath of different countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions to be answered\n",
    "\n",
    "> Using statistical analysis and visualization, what questions would you like to be able answer about this dataset.\n",
    "> This could include questions such as:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - What is the relationship between X and Y variables?\n",
    "> - What is the distribution of the variables?\n",
    "> - What is the relationship between the variables and the target?\n",
    ">   You will need to frame these questions in a way to show value to a stakeholder (i.e.why should we know about the relationship between X and Y variables?)\n",
    "\n",
    "> - Which top 10 countries have the highestclimate change risk?\n",
    "> - IS there a realtionship between the potential risk and the countrie's gap?\n",
    "> - How does pessimistic vs optimistic affect mid century risk?\n",
    "> - What is the distribution of baseline, mid-century, and scenario-specific risk across the countries?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "> Provide a few examples of what you plan to visualize to answer the questions you posed in the previous section. In this project, you will be producing 6-8 visualizations. You will also be producing an interactive chart using Plotly.\n",
    "> Think about what those visualization could be: what are the variables used in the charts? what insights do you hope to gain from them?\n",
    "    > - Line Chart : Shows the trend of risk growth over decades\n",
    "    > - Plotly Interactive Map - Shows a hotstops in each countries of climate change.\n",
    "    > - Bar Chart - Top 10 countries by baseline risk : shows which countries have the highest risk currently\n",
    "    > - Histogram - Shows the the riskd level distubuted globally\n",
    "    > - Scatter Plot- shows the relationship of the current capcity and the prjected risk\n",
    "    > - Stacked Bar Chart - Shows the ocuntires with the largest population at risk with different scenarios \n"
